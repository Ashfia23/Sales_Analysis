Sales-Insights-Analysis-Project
## Abstract
In this project I will be conducting a basic sales analysis using MySQL and Power BI.

## Introduction
This project will show how you can download data from MySQL, perform preliminary data analysis, extract, transform and load data into Tableau.

Next, we will build 2 different dashboards on Tableau showing the revenue and profit of various sales.

At the end of the project, we will visualize the revenue and profit trends for various years starting from 2017 to 2020.

## Purpose

## Insights
After a quick data exploration in MySQL, here are some initial findings:

*The database contains 5 tables: customers, date, markets, products, and transactions.
There are 17 markets, 279 products, and 38 customers.
The observation period is from OCT 2017 to JUN 2020.
The total revenue in 2020 was ₹ 142.22 M, 57.7% less than 2019, which was ₹ 336.02 M.
Most of the transactions data are in INR(₹) currency, but we have 2 records in US($) currency.
And we got some garbage values in sales amount and market column. We’re going to deal with it in the ETL process.
